# Understanding the Code for Epsilon Closure Calculation

## Purpose of the Code
The provided C code is designed to calculate the epsilon closure of a set of states in a finite automaton. The epsilon closure of a state in a finite automaton is the set of states that can be reached from the original state using epsilon transitions (transitions that don't consume input).

## Libraries Included
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
```
These lines include the standard input/output and string manipulation libraries.

## Global Variables
```c
char result[20][20], copy[3], states[20][20];
```
- `result[20][20]`: 2D array to store the epsilon closure of each state.
- `copy[3]`: Array to store a copy of the current state being processed.
- `states[20][20]`: 2D array to store the input states.

## Function Definitions

### `void add_state(char a[3], int i)`
This function adds a state to the result array.
- Parameters:
  - `a[3]`: State to be added.
  - `i`: Index to keep track of the number of states added.

### `void display(int n)`
This function displays the epsilon closure of a state.
- Parameters:
  - `n`: Number of states in the closure.

## `main()` Function

### Opening Input File
```c
FILE *INPUT;
INPUT = fopen("input.dat", "r");
```
Opens a file named "input.dat" in read mode. This file is assumed to contain transition information.

### Reading Input
```c
int n, k = 0;
char state[3];
printf("Enter the no. of states: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
printf("Enter the states: ");
for (k = 0; k < n; k++)
{
    scanf("%s", states[k]);
}
```
- Takes the number of states (`n`) as input.
- Reads and stores the states in the `states` array.

### Epsilon Closure Calculation
```c
for (k = 0; k < n; k++)
{
    i = 0;
    strcpy(state, states[k]);
    strcpy(copy, state);
    add_state(state, i++);
    while (1)
    {
        // ...
    }
    display(i);
    rewind(INPUT);
}
```
- Iterates through each input state.
- Initializes the epsilon closure with the current state.
- Reads transition information from the file (`state1`, `input`, `state2`).
- If the transition is an epsilon transition ("e"), adds the target state to the epsilon closure.
- Displays the epsilon closure for each state.

### Closing File
```c
fclose(INPUT);
```
Closes the input file.

### Return Statement
```c
return 0;
```
Indicates successful execution of the program.

## Summary
The code calculates and displays the epsilon closure for each state in a finite automaton based on the transition information provided in the "input.dat" file. The epsilon closure is determined by following epsilon transitions from the initial state. The result is displayed for each input state.
